# PR Against the Correct Branch!

Amp development spans two primary branches. PHP 5.x compatibility takes
place in the v1.0.x branch. All contributions to this branch must
retain compatibility with PHP 5.5+. The master branch supports only PHP7+
and is aliased as v1.1.0-dev . Please submit PRs against the appropriate
branch.
